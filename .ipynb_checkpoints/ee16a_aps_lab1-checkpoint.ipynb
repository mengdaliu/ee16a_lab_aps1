    "This is a long lab, but it is all software. You will not have to use any sort of hardware, so if you do not finish within the allotted time, feel free to finish at home and get this lab checked off next week. There are many conclusive tests that will guide you. If you get stuck, drop by office hours for a lab TA and ask for help or post on Piazza.\n",

    "There are various positioning systems in our life, and we use them every day. The most commonly used one is the [Global Positioning System (GPS)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System). The navigation systems in cars, Google Maps, cell phones, and even rockets and spaceships all use the GPS.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we are going to explore the basics of these navigation systems and build our own. At the end of this lab module, you will have written software (and tested it on real data) that can give you your location in a 2D space!\n",

    "## Basic Principle of Operation\n",
    "GPS satellites broadcast a variety of measurements including time from a very precise clock, as well as the satellite's position, velocity, etc. GPS receivers make use of the fact that light propagates at a known speed, so the receiver can compute distance from the satellite by measuring how long it takes the GPS signal to propagate from the satellite to the receiver.\n",

    "Just like the GPS, we will use speakers as our signal emitters (like the \"GPS satellite\"), and use microphones (our version of the \"GPS radio chip\") to receive the signals. Using the microphone, we have essentially created an Acoustic Positioning System (APS), as opposed to a Global Positioning System. We can determine distances to each satellite based on the delay between the times at which we receive each signal.\n",

    "Just like real GPS, our APS setup will have multiple speaker-satellites emitting signals, and a single microphone receiver. The signal that we receive at the microphone will be a sum of the individual speaker outputs. We will sift through the microphone signal to find audio signals that are unique from each speaker. We will use a tool called **cross-correlation** to perform this sifting. In order to perform cross-correlation, we are essentially comparing the signal we receive with a stored copies of the signal coming from the speakers. \n",
    "\n",
    "**[Cross-correlation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-correlation)** is a measure of similarity between two signals. It is a mathematical operation defined by taking successive products as one function slides past the other. More intuitively this is a measure of the \"common area\" or \"overlap\" between two signals with respect to time. For discrete signals, the \"common area\" at time $t$ is the product of the two signals evaluated at that time. Both a mathematical definition and an animation are shown below where $x$ and $y$ are real valued functions.\n",

To be specific, $\\vec{y}[n-m]$ is $\\vec{y}[n]$ delayed by $m$. If $n-m$ is out of the range $[0, N-1]$, we divide $n-m$ with $N$ and take a positive remainder within the $[0, N-1]$ range.

    "Our positioning system will be transmitting what we will call a *beacon signal* from each speaker. Figure 3a shows example waveforms of a system composed of two beacons. The beacons are synchronized, meaning each beacon signal is transmitted from one of the speakers at the same time. Figure 3b demonstrates a scenario where the microphone is farther away from beacon 2, picking up its signal with a 3 millisecond delay with respect to beacon 1.\n",

Performing a *cross-correlation* of the recorded audio signal with stored copies of each beacon signal will tell us the time when the beacon signal arrives at the microphone. This will be the time that has maximum cross-correlation for a given beacon. As shown in Figure 4b, the cross-correlation of the recorded audio with a stored copy of beacon 1 has a maximum location that is separated by 3 milliseconds from the maximum location of the cross-correlation with beacon 2. Using this separation, we can infer that the distance of the microphone from the first beacon is less than the distance from the second beacon.\n",

In order to robustly identify the beacon signals with our single microphone recording, we would like for the same beacon signal to have a large cross-correlation with itself, but a very small cross-correlation with all of the others. \n",

The theory and implementation of these signals is beyond the scope of this class, but simply understanding the properties of cross correlation explained above is enough to show why we will be using them. In the support code for this lab over the next few weeks, we have provided a large set of Gold Codes that are designed to work together well. \n",
